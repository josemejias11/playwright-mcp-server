```

## Test Commands

### Local Execution
```bash
npm run smoke          # Critical path validation
npm run accessibility  # WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
npm run functional     # Content and functionality tests  
npm run performance    # Load time validation
npm run security       # Security validation
```

### Docker Execution (Isolated & Consistent)
```bash
./docker-test.sh smoke          # Smoke tests in Docker
./docker-test.sh accessibility  # Accessibility tests (25/25 tests)
./docker-test.sh functional     # Functional tests in Docker
./docker-test.sh api            # API tests (78/78 assertions)
./docker-test.sh test           # All tests comprehensively
./docker-test.sh performance    # Performance tests
./docker-test.sh security       # Security tests
./docker-test.sh clean          # Clean up containers
```

### API Testing (100% Success Rate)
```bash
npm run api            # Complete API test suite
npm run api:detailed   # Enhanced HTML reports

# Category-specific testing
newman run postman/API-Tests.postman_collection.json \
  -e postman/Environment.postman_environment.json \
  --folder "Smoke Tests"
```

### Combined Strategies
```bash
npm run suite:quick    # Smoke + Functional (8-13 min)
npm run suite:quality  # Performance + Accessibility + Security (7-11 min)
npm run suite:all      # All test suites including full accessibility (25-35 min)
```

## Framework Architecture

### üéØ Adaptive Testing Features
- **Website-specific configurations** - Easy switching between different target websites
- **Flexible selector strategies** - Robust element detection across different sites
- **Fallback mechanisms** - Reliable testing even when page structures vary
- **Visual documentation** - Automatic screenshot capture for validation

### Adding New Websites

1. Add website configuration to `e2e/config/website-configs.js`
2. Update environment variable `TARGET_WEBSITE`
3. Create website-specific page objects if needed
4. Tests automatically adapt to new configurations

The framework is designed to be **demo-ready** and **extensible** - perfect for showcasing modern web testing capabilities! üöÄ

## API Test Organization

The API suite is organized into 8 professional categories:

- **Smoke Tests** (14 assertions) - Critical path validation
- **Functional Tests** (15 assertions) - Content and functionality
- **Security Tests** (12 assertions) - HTTPS and security headers  
- **Performance Tests** (10 assertions) - Response time benchmarks
- **SEO Tests** (9 assertions) - Metadata and structure validation
- **Contact Form Tests** (8 assertions) - Form functionality
- **Cross-Platform Tests** (6 assertions) - Mobile/desktop compatibility
- **Business Tests** (4 assertions) - Professional standards validation

**Results:** 78/78 passing assertions | 100% success rate | 68ms average response time
