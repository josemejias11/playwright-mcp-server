- **Educational Smoke Tests** (14 assertions) - Critical educational path validation
- **Educational Content Tests** (15 assertions) - Reading levels and curriculum content
- **Student Privacy Security Tests** (12 assertions) - COPPA/FERPA compliance and privacy
- **Educational Performance Tests** (10 assertions) - Learning engagement response times
- **Educational SEO Tests** (9 assertions) - Educational metadata and structure validation
